function [mm,ind] = swapping(m)
%SWAPPING  Choose confluent permutation ordered by average index.
%   [MM,IND] = SWAPPING(M) takes a vector M containing the integers
%   1:K (some repeated if K < LENGTH(M)), where M(J) is the index of
%   the block into which the element T(J,J) of a Schur form T
%   should be placed.
%   It constructs a vector MM (a permutation of M) such that T(J,J)
%   will be located in the MM(J)'th block counting from the (1,1) position.
%   The algorithm used is to order the blocks by ascending
%   average index in M, which is a heuristic for minimizing the number
%   of swaps required to achieve this confluent permutation.
%   The cell array vector IND defines the resulting block form:
%   IND{i} contains the indices of the i'th block in the permuted form.
